## üéÆ gmboy

`gmboy` is a Game Boy emulator built in Rust as a deep dive into how emulation and hardware works.  
Built for fun and learning, it‚Äôs a project about clean code, deep hardware understanding, and striving for high accuracy and test coverage.
It's not just an emulator ‚Äî it's a playground for experimentation.

## Supports

-  **Full CPU Emulation**  
  Full instruction set of Sharp LR35902 CPU with accurate timing (instruction and sub-instruction).

- **Full PPU Emulation (Graphics)**  
  Rendering of background, window, and sprites.

- **Full APU Emulation (Audio)**  
  Sound output with all 4 audio channels.

- **Input Handling**  
  Emulates button inputs (D-Pad, A, B, Start, Select).

- **Cartridge Support**  
  Handles ROM loading and MBC0, MBC1, MBC2.

## Features

- **Multiple Palettes**  
  Includes different color palettes with ability to add through config file.

- **Slow and Turbo Modes**  
  Ability to slow down and speed up emulation.

- **Rewind**  
  Rewind gameplay to undo mistakes.

-  **Tests**  
   Integrated SM83 json tests, blargg tests, mooneye test suite (throught `cargo test`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

First, make sure you have Rust installed. If you don't, install it with:
````
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
````
Then, install dependencies: SDL2

Arch Linux:
```bash
sudo pacman -S sdl2
````

After that, you should be able to build:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
## Planned features
